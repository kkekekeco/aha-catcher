# 💡 Project: Aha! Catcher
## Phase 1: Product Definition Brief

---

### 🎯 The Core Problem
Fleeting ideas and moments of curiosity are often lost because the friction to capture and follow up on them is too high. 

*   **Mission:** Lower capture friction so dramatically that recording an "Aha!" moment becomes an unconscious reflex.
*   **Target:** Ideas of **medium intentionality**—not urgent enough to stop for, but valuable enough to regret losing.

---

### 👤 User & Context
*   **Primary User:** Me (Personal Tool).
*   **Primary Context:** Engaged in other activities (walking, listening to podcasts, talking) where pulling out a phone to type is disruptive or impossible.
*   **Goal:** Capture the seed of an idea with **zero interruption** to the primary activity.

---

### ⚡ Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
The absolute simplest version that feels like "magic":
1.  **Trigger:** A single, simple gesture.
2.  **Capture:** Automatically records the last 30 seconds of ambient audio.
3.  **Processing:** Sends audio to an AI for transcription and analysis.
4.  **Output:** Delivers a useful, structured follow-up note for later review.

### 📈 Objectives & Key Results (OKRs)

#### **Objective 1: Capture ideas with zero friction.**
*   **KR 1:** The capture action must be a single, simple gesture.
*   **KR 2:** The entire process, from gesture to the AI receiving the audio, must be invisible to any outside observer.

#### **Objective 2: Deliver a useful, actionable follow-up.**
*   **KR 1:** The AI must accurately transcribe the audio.
*   **KR 2:** The AI must intelligently infer the core "Aha!" moment and perform a relevant background search. The result should be a concise note containing the original thought and the research summary.
*   **KR 3:** The latency from gesture to the final note being available for review should be **under 2 minutes**.
